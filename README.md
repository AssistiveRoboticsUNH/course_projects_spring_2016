# course_projects_spring_2016
Course Projects from UNH's Human Interaction without their own repository

Each student should commit their project in a seperate folder named \<student_name\>_project.
At the root of each project have a README containing any information you think is necessary
to run your projects (libraries needed, paths used etc). Skip large files (many images, large rosbags etc).
